{"principal exhibitions": "Canaletto e Bellotto: L'arte della veduta, Palazzo Bricherasio, Turin, 2008, cat. 80.", "current accession number": "1352-1869", "material": "oil on canvas", "description": "This painting is a remarkable example of Canaletto's 'capricci', i.e. fantasy views, produced during his career along with more realistic views. This work shows a ruined bridge with a tower and a gatehouse on the right, an archway with a Corinthian column surmounted by the statue of a ram or a sheep on the left and, beyond the bridge, a city receding into the distance while small figures are wandering about. Particularly interesting is the pictorial rendering of light enlivened by strong shadows and a wide range of tones from warm to cool nuances in a free brushwork that suggests rather than delineates the forms. Giovanni Antonio Canal, called Canaletto, was born in Venice and was trained there by his father, Bernardo Canal, a theatrical scenery painter, and his uncle, Cristoforo. He accompanied them to Rome where he remained a few months, maybe more, and directed his artistic development towards view paintings including fantasy views and landscapes while gradually working his way into realistic view painting. He was a member of the Venetian painters' guild, the Fraglia, in 1720. He moved to England in 1746 and remained there until at least 1755, a sojourn interrupted by short visits to Venice. He trained his nephew, the view painter Bernardo Bellotto (1721-1780), who became a member of the Fraglia in 1738, and perhaps Michele Marieschi (1696-1743) and Francesco Guardi (1712-1793). He also had a certain influence on the English school of painting, especially Samuel Scott (ca.1702-1772), and established the vogue for views of London.

The free brushwork and the somewhat dryness of the pencil also associate this piece with the work of Bernardo Bellotto, Canaletto's nephew, who produced several 'capricci' in an identical manner. However this painting appears close to another 'capriccio' by Canaletto: A castle on a bridge by the lagoon, Edward Speelman collection, London, and its related drawing, Schaeffer Galleries, New York, which reproduces with variations this compositional idea. According to Martini (1985), this painting is of 'straordinaria bellezza' (extraordinary beauty) because of the richness of the composition and the play of light from warm to cool nuances. A few 'pentimenti' (i.e. corrections) appear here and there such as the cross in the middle of the bridge, originally inclined in a diametrically opposite direction, as well as in the edifices receding into the distance. This painting witnesses the continued production of 'capricci' in Canaletto's oeuvre from the early Capriccio with a bridge, private collection, dated 1721-22, to the late A castle on a bridge by the lagoon, mentioned above, dated ca. 1760, of which the present painting may have been the prototype.", "subject": "landscape; buildings and gardens"}

It depicts the surroundings of Villeneuve, a city in the Alps of Haute Provence in France. The composition combines one of Calame's greatest successes, the depiction of idyllic lake scene (here Lake Lucerne), with the representation of the Alps, which appears to be the main thematic of his oeuvre. This painting does not appear to be a finished version but a preparatory study which Calame would rework in his studio. Alexandre Calame was born in Vevey but studied in Geneva under Fran\u00e7ois Diday and then travelled in Northern Europe and Italy until 1850. He soon specialised in mountain paintings especially the Alps, the Bernese Oberland and central Switzerland. He was also a prolific draughtsman and engraver.

This aesthetic is not far from that of the Romantic movement and its use of nature as a mirror of the human and divine mind. The small figure in the foreground, perched on the top of rock is representative of such conception of an overwhelming and omnipotent nature against human fragility.This painting was bequeathed by the Rev. Townshend who owned a large collection of 19th-century landscape paintings. Townshend, who resided part of the year in Lausanne, acquired this painting directly from the artist. It is listed in the 1868 post-mortem register of the contents of his villa in Lausanne (V&A R/F MA/1/T1181) as 'Oil on Canvas. Study from nature. By A. Calame. Signed. Swiss. Present century'. 'Chauncy Hare Townshend (1798-1868) was born into a wealthy family, only son of Henry Hare Townsend of Busbridge Hall, Godalming, Surrey. Educated at Eton and Trinity Hall, Cambridge (BA 1821). Succeeded to the family estates 1827, when he added 'h' to the Townsend name. He had taken holy orders, but while he always referred to himself as 'Rev.' on the title pages of his books, he never practised his vocation.... Very much a dilettante in the eighteenth-century sense, he moved in the highest social and literary circles; a great friend of Charles Dickens (he was the dedicatee of Great Expectations) with whom he shared a fascination of mesmerism... Bulwer Lytton described his life's 'Beau-deal of happiness' as 'elegant rest, travel, lots of money - and he is always ill and melancholy'. Of the many watercolours and British and continental oil paintings he bequeathed to the V&A, the majority are landscapes.  He is the first identifiable British collector of early photographs apart from the Prince Consort, particularly landscape photography, and also collected gems and geological specimens.'
