{"current accession number": "549-1870", "measurements": "47.0 x 73.6 cm", "description": "This painting is an early ninetenth-century copy after an engraved composition by Canaletto, dated 1735-46, just before his departure to England. It shows a palace designed by Jacopo Sansovino (1486-1570), which housed the national library (Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana) and the ancient Mint (Zecca) while the base of the Campanile is at the far right. On the left, the corner column of the Basilica of San Marco and a pedestal from which proclamations were read (piera del bando) function as a repoussoir device, i.e. a motif positioned in the right or left foreground in order to lead the spectator's eye into the picture. In the background, a puppet theatre near the column of S. Teodoro entertains a small crowd of people. Very close to Canaletto's style of painting, this composition documents the early 1740s topography of Venice as well as the lifestyle of the Venetian society. Giovanni Antonio Canal called Canaletto (1697-1768) was born in Venice and trained there by his father, Bernardo Canal, a theatrical scenery painter, and his uncle, Cristoforo. He accompanied them to Rome where he remained a few months, maybe more, and directed his artistic development towards view paintings including fantasy views and landscapes while gradually working his way into realistic view painting. He was a member of the Venetian painters' guild, the Fraglia, in 1720. He moved to England in 1746 and remained there until at least 1755, a sojourn interrupted by short visits to Venice. He trained his nephew, the view painter Bernardo Bellotto (1721-1780), who became a member of the Fraglia in 1738, and perhaps Michele Marieschi (1696-1743) and Francesco Guardi (1712-1793).

It shows a fair in the Piazza San Marco in Venice scattered with small figures wearing typical colourful Venetian cloaks and three-cornered hats as was the fashion during the 18th century in Venice. The whole view is seen through an archway with the basilica and the campanile in the background under a wide blue sky. The piazza San Marco was an important place in the Venetian public life: temporary huts at the foot of the Campanile usually hosted plays of the Commedia dell'Arte performing, among others, the story of Columbine and Harlequin. The city was since the Middle Ages an important milestone on the route between Europe and the East and benefited thus greatly from the trade of spices, fabrics and all sorts of items. The fair depicted here illustrates well the constant trading activity of the city, in which the whole Venetian society participated. In that respect, 'vedute' paintings of this kind not only recorded the appearance of the city but also documented the Venetian social life. Francesco Guardi was born in Venice and specialised in little views of the city. He was a collaborator of Canaletto when he was in his 40s and became later popular running a large studio of his own.

Spender who recognised in the shadows of related figures that fall in diametrically opposite directions an essential characteristic of Giacomo's manner. Prof. A. Morassi however rejected both of these attributions. Although the wide atmospheric sky recalls Guardi's typical emphasis on the pictorial rendering of light, the thickness of the brushstroke betrays a 19th-century imitation. Francesco Guardi has been much imitated in his lifetime and for more than a century after his death. His compositions were extremely popular and provided great models to copy.The composition relates to a Canaletto (1697-1768) late painting in Lord Wharton collection, Halswell Park, Somerset, and to a drawing (whereabouts unknown, formerly Henry Oppenheimer collection), both showing the scene from the same angle with an identical row of canvas-covered booths, continued into temporary huts at the foot of the Campanile. The figures however differ significantly from the present work and analogously the drawing and the painting feature a hanging lamp in the foreground that is missing in CAI.101, however close in dimension to Canaletto's painting (69 x 60.5 cm). CAI.101 looks similar to a smaller version (50 x 41 cm) by Francesco Guardi, known to have copied the master's work in his early years, which is in the Staedelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt. Guardi seems to have favoured this particular compositional scheme showing a view through an archway and produced a number of works based on this idea (see for instance Venetian Capriccio: View of a Square and a Palace The Hermitage, St Petersburg, and  Venetian Capriccio: View of the Ducal Palace formerly Koetser collection, New York).The collection formed by Constantine Ionides includes works of a wide variety of schools, periods and artists. His collection includes Old Masters, seventeenth century works, contemporary British works and French 19th century works. Constantine formed friendships with artists of the day, especially Legros, who, having spent 17 years in Britain, became a naturalised British citizen. Constantine proved a stable and generous buyer of Legros' work, while Legros, in turn, became an advisor in the matters of art to the attentive Constantine. Under the influence of Legros Constantine developed a keen interest in French 19th century paintings purchasing works by Delacroix, Degas, Millet and Rousseau. Constantine's plans concerning his collection conformed to a more 'public-welfare' vein of thought than his father or brother. He decided to donate his collection to the Victoria & Albert Museum, instead of privately distributing it or disposing of it in a sales room. His will states: 'All my pictures both in oil and water colors and crayon or colored chalks (but subject as to my family portraits to the interest herein before given to my said Wife) and all my etchings drawings and engravings to the South Kensington Museum for the benefit of the nation to be kept there as one separate collection to be called \"The Constantine Alexander Ionides Collection\" and not distributed over the Museum or lent for exhibition. And I desire that the said Etchings Drawings and Engravings shall be framed and glazed by and at the expense of the authorities of the Museum so that Students there can easily see them.' The collection bequeathed to the museum in 1901 comprises 1138 pictures, drawing and prints, to which a further 20 items were added on the death of his widow in 1920. The works are listed in the V&A catalogue of the Constantine Alexander Ionides collection. ", "subject": "buildings and gardens; figure; place (Venice)"}

A close drawing by Canaletto, albeit with variations, relates to this etching (Windsor, 7423). It shows the opposite side of the Piazza S. Marco looking towards the church of S. Geminiano and the Procuratorie Nuove on the left. The Procuratorie is an imposing building, named after its primary function as a house for the procurators of S. Marco. This edifice delimits the whole S. Marco's square and is divided into three sections respectively called Procuratorie Vecchie on the north side of the square, the Ala Napoleonica on the west side and the Procuratorie Nuove on the south side. At the far end, one can distinguish S. Geminiano's church, which displays its new Renaissance fa\u00e7ade designed by the Italian architect Jacopo Sansovino (1486-1570) and was subsequently demolished by Napoleon I in order to achieve the Ala Napoleonica (Napoleonic wing) designed by Giuseppe Soli in 1810. At the far left, there is the corner arch of the basilica of S. Marco known as Arco di S. Alipio and on the right, a side view of the Torre dell'Orologio (clock tower of S.

Artists such as Antonio Joli and William James reproduced many compositions of the master and several anonymous works deriving from the etching are known (see for instance, formerly Galerie San Giorgio, Rome; formerly F. Leverton Harris, London; private collection, Southampton). Antonio Joli painted a very close view (sold Christie's London, 09 Apr. 1990, lot 99) while Francesco Guardi, who probably worked with Canaletto, executed two paintings of the same view most likely made after Canaletto's engraving (formerly Harris collection, London, Midy collection, Paris and Private collection, Switzerland).John Meeson Parsons (1798-1870), art collector, was born in Newport, Shropshire.

In his will he offered his collection of mostly German and Dutch schools to the National Gallery (which selected only three works) and to the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington, later the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Museum acquired ninety-two oil paintings and forty-seven watercolours. A number of engravings were also left to the British Museum.", "subject": "buildings and gardens; figure; place (Venice); marine; religion (church)"}

However, this painting is more likely to be by a later imitator. The format was developed in religious imagery, where the ring of flowers related to the rosary used in devotion to the Virgin, but was also applied to portraits, often painted by another artist. This painting is unusual because of the large scale of the woman and the erotic nature of the scene. These features suggest an eighteenth-century date, and an attribution to an artist who was not concerned with the original religious connotations.", "artist": " Attributed to manner of Seghers, Daniel (Flemish painter, 1590-1661)  Previously attributed to Seghers, Daniel (Flemish painter, 1590-1661) ", "url": "http://www.vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=86561", "rights owner": "Kirklees Metropolitan Council", "date earliest": "possibly 1700", "material": "oil on canvas", "acquisition details": "Given by Dorothy Una Ratcliffe McGrigor Phillips 1964.", "collection": "Huddersfield Art Gallery", "image_id": "klmus_2176_1983.jpg", "alternative title": "Portrait", "publications": "Halliday, J.
