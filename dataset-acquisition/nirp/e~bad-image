It was attributed by Denis Mahon in 1958 to Morazzone, having previously been catalogued as Spanish school. Mahon's reasons were largely based on the apparent up-to-dateness of the work for 1598, which would probably indicate an artist working in Rome and he believed it held 'a certain Milanese air' which led him to Morazzone, who was probably working in Rome at that time. In fact Morazzone's Saint Joseph's Dream in Berlin bears some figurative and compositional likeness to the Hatton painting. Mahon also suggested the influence of the young Guercino, the Carracci, and a familiarity with the Bernini circle. The current attribution to Cerano appears to be chiefly based on the similarity of the crucifix in this work to that in Cerano's painting S. Francesco adorante il Crocifisso in the Musei Civici del Castello Sforzesco in Milan. This attribution is apparently not invalidated by the comparatively early date, as Cerano worked for the Casa Borromeo in Milan in 1590. Cerano painted several versions of Saint Francis, some of which do bear striking similarities to the Hatton version. Of particular significance are the face of Saint Francis in a painting of the same name in Brera, Milan, and the face of an angel in Angels playing to Saint Francis in Isola Bella, Palazzo Borromeo. However, the painting technique in the work is inconsistent, and is possibly the product of several members of a studio. The conservation report of 1955 also questions the originality of the angel, or believes it may represent a later addition by the artist himself. In light of these areas of doubt, an attribution has also been made to the studio of Cerano.

In 1974, Ben Nicholson thought the painting to be by the Master of the Karlsruhe Drinkey, and in 1979 ascribed it to his master G, a North Netherlandish artist in Rome. Ralph Holland suggested the current attribution to Mola, based on the painting's resemblance to one in the Ashmolean, known to have been owned by Mola. Certainly current research shows that the work would not have been unusual in Mola's oeuvre. He frequently painted head and shoulder studies of men, and his free flowing and expressive use of paint is similar to that seen in the Hatton work. Mola's Study of Soldiers in a private collection concentrates on facial gestures of horror and fear. In his drawing The Family of Lucretia finding her dead body the figure on the left bears a similar facial expression to Blind Man. Interestingly, studies of heads of men shouting or in pain were not uncommon in seventeenth-century Italy. It is also worth noting the work's striking similarity to Guido Reni's Head of a Man Screaming of 1619-21, a drawing now in the Louvre, and composed as a figure study for a larger, painted composition, possibly as part of one of the four paintings of the Life of Hercules executed for the Gonzaga family. In this drawing it is interesting to note that though the eyes are depicted in a way resembling those of the Hatton work, the man is in fact not blind, but his eyes have rolled to the back of his head in pain. It is therefore suggested that the Hatton painting could be a similar study that has been misinterpreted in the past.", "subject": "figure; everyday life"}
