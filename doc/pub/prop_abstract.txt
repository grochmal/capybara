# Abstract of the Style Based Drawn Artwork Image Classification work

A picture is worth a thousand words, therefore an image may mean something
completely different depending how we look at it.  This is even more apparent
when we look at works of art, where the artist actively works to produce a
meaning in his work.  One way to look at artistic drawings, paintings and
illustrations is to consider the meaning of style.  This work will use
features extracted from artistic images to classify them by style.  A
classifier capable of recognising the artistic style of famous painters will
be built and evaluated.  Such classifiers are currently used in CBIR engines
for art retrieval and can be further employed to organise collections of
digitalised drawn art.  Collections from the Victoria and Albert Museum and
the Virtual Arts Directory Service will be used to engineer this
classification.
